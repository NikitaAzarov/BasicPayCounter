2. Create a text document where you will write all your work shifts in this format:<br>
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM HH:MM`<br>
Example: `2024-08-04 10:00 14:00`<br>
The first time is the start of your shift, and the second time is the end of your shift.

You can write more than one shift in the file. Each shift should be on a new line.
